<div class="text-base">
<p>Welcome!</p>
<br>
<p>My name is Tymur and this is my personal page.</p>
<br>
<p>Here you can check info <a class="underline" href="/profile">about</a>
    me, have a look at some <a class="underline" href="/post">blog</a> posts and also you can ask me
    about anything using the chat <a class="underline" href="/chat">page</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>This webpage is done using a Laravel framework and for each page there are provided links to view, controller an
    model; if you are learning Laravel or just curious â€” check it out.</p>
<br>
<p>Moreover the frontend is implemented in two ways: with Blade and with Inertia+Vue components. You can switch
    between them using a button in the footer.
    The idea was to render a same-looking view using different approaches.</p>
<br>
<p>For the full project code check my github <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/tymur778/laravel-blade-vue">account</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me via chat or email.</p>
