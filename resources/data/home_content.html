<div class="text-base">
<p>Welcome!</p>
<br>
<p>My name is Tymur and this is my personal page.</p>
<br>
<p>On this webpage you can:
    <br>- check more info <a class="underline" href="/profile">about</a> me,
    <br>- have a look at some <a class="underline" href="/post">blog</a> posts and
    <br>- ask me about anything using the <a class="underline" href="/chat">chat</a> page.</p>
<br>
<p>This app is done using the Laravel framework; the front end is implemented in two ways: with Blade and with Inertia+Vue components â€” you can switch between them using a button in the footer.
    The idea was to render a same-looking page using different templating engines.</p>
<br>
<p>Furthermore, in the footer, you can find links to the current view, controller, and model.
    Whether you're a Laravel learner or simply curious, be sure to take a look.</p>
<br>
<p>There is a <a class="underline" href="/blog/1">blog post</a> with more details about this app. For the full project code check my github <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/tymur778/laravel-blade-vue">account</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me via chat or email.</p>
